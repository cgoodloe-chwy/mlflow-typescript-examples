## Resources

- [ðŸ“¦ MLflow TypeScript SDK (npm)](https://npmjs.com/package/mlflow-tracing)
- [ðŸ’» MLflow Github Repository](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow)
- [ðŸ“– MLflow TypeScript SDK Documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/app-instrumentation/typescript-sdk)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm or yarn
- Python >= 3.10 (Only required to run MLflow server. If you use [managed MLflow]())

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. Start an application:

   Start the full-stack chatbot integrated with MLflow tracing using [MLflow Typescript SDK](https://npmjs.com/package/mlflow-tracing)

   ```bash
   npm run chatbot
   ```

   If you run the command for the first time, it will prompt you to setup the environment and MLflow tracking server.

   Once the app is running, you can access to the chatbot app at `http://localhost:5173` and ask questions.

3. Review the traces in MLflow UI

   Traces will be logged to the MLflow Experiment you specified in the setup process. Select the `Traces` tab to see the list of traces and click on each row to see the details, such as spans, timelines, messages, tool call parameters, etc.
